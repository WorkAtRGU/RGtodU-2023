###Use cases###
End user
- Create Task
- View a task
- View all tasks
- Edit a task
- del a task
- Add to Calendar using Calendar app service
- Do a task using Clock app service
- Sync data stores (depended on by create, view view all, edit, del tasks). Uses cloud Firebase service and Device RoomSQL database

todo: insert images of task and user flows for above tasks

### Pages ###
All pages below are implemented as a fragment, hosted in MainActivity, with navigation implemened using Navigation component.
** Home page **
todo: insert screenshot of home page
- First screen when opening app, implemented as a fragment, uses ConstraintLayout to position Views responsively for different device screens and orientattions.
- Uses buttons to get input from user to select which page to load next

** Create / Edit task **
todo: insert screenshot of create task / edit task page
- The same fragment is used, when a task is passed in (i.e. to be edited) its values are used to prepopulate the Views.
- Screen to create a new task, uses nested LinearLayouts to position views. Doesn't work well in landscape orientation.
- Uses TextViews as labels to instruct users; EditText with type text (task name) or multiline (objective), number (pomodotors) to display appropriate keybaord, RadioButtons to restict priority selection, drop down list for status to only show current, calendar to select deadline, Buttons to save TAsk or cancel operation.

** View a task **
todo: insert screenshot
- Screen to display details of a task
- Uses TextViews as nothing is editable, organised using ConstraintLayout
- Includes Buttons to launch Calendar app, with a timer for 25 minutes to work on that task; Button to switch to edit task; Button to delete task.

** View all asks **
todo: insert screenshot
- Screen to view all tasks
- Uses a RecyclerView with a custom layout file for each item, to display the task name, pomodoros remaining and button to view tasks


** Navigation **
todo: insert navigation graph screenshot
- based on Navigation graph
- Bottom menu added to provide navigation between home and view tasks pages
- Other navigation via buttons

** Lifecycle events **
- Uses lifecycle aware Views to ensure UI remains consistent
- Uses lifecycle listeners to store state of member variables, and restores these in onViewCreated callback

** Web service **
Uses Firebase Realtime API, providing HTTP API for create, get, update, delete tasks, exchanged using JSON with keys:
- task id
- objective
- status
- priority
- deadline

** Data store **
Stores data in a single RoomsQL database table, with columns
